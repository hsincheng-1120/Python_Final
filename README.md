This project aims to develop an interactive dashboard for monitoring work order status and production efficiency in manufacturing. Users can filter data based on criteria such as work order status, production line, and time range. The dashboard provides visual insights through various charts. The system enhances transparency, helping managers identify bottlenecks, reduce delays, and optimize resource allocation.
